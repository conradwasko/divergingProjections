Projections of extreme rainfall and streamflow for Australia's hydrologic reference stations using CMIP5 (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) for AEPs of 90%, 80%, 50%, 20%, 10%, 5% and 2% for the time horizons 2036–2065 (nominally centred on 2050) and 2070–2099 (centred on 2085) relative to the historical baseline of 1976-2005.

A detailed description of the methods used to generate this data are provided in: Wasko, C., Guo, D., Ho, M., Nathan, R., Vogel, E., 2023. Diverging projections for flood and rainfall frequency curves. Journal of Hydrology 620, 129403. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2023.129403

If using this data a citation to the above manuscript would be greatly appreciated.

## Details
This repository contains data for replicating Figures 7-9 in Wasko et al (2023). The zip files contain the percentage changes for each climate model-downscaling pairing for each station, which each file named with the station ID, with "fut1" and "fut2" being the 2050 and 2085 time horizons respectively.
